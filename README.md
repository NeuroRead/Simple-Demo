# Simple-Demo

A simple demo site to test the PaCRAT API and NeuroRead Concept.

## Inspiration

As a college student, reading is half our lives. Whether it's textbooks, assignment descriptions, or just for fun, we need to ingest paragraph after paragraph of academic text every day. However, neurodivergent and dyslexic learners often disproportionately struggle with digesting these types of complex text, with these readers seeing paragraphs as walls of chaos. Uniform font weights, sizes, and spacing mean that there are no fixation points for our eyes to keep track of progress, and this can result in the feeling of being "lost" in a piece of text. **We set out to create a method to break up large paragraphs and create more emphasis and fixation points to help alleviate pain points involved in reading academic texts.** 

## What it does

**NeuroRead takes in paragraphs, and weights sentences based on their complexity.** The more complex the individual sentence, the more emphasized it is. This serves to break up "walls of text", while also telling the reader's brain to focus more on the sentences that will be more difficult to process. **NeuroRead aims to improve the reader's comprehension of the paragraph and make the reading experience more pleasant and accessible overall**
